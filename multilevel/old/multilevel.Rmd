# Packages and Dataset

```{r}
library(pprint)
library(tidyverse)
library(Statamarkdown)
```

```{r}
setwd("C:/Users/slupp/OneDrive/Skrivebord/NTNU/Mehmet/PSY8003/multilevel")
depression <- readRDS("depression.rds")
```

```{stata}
cd "C:\Users\slupp\OneDrive\Skrivebord\NTNU\Mehmet\PSY8003\multilevel"
use depression.dta
```

# Converting From Wide to Long Format

1.  Most Softwares require long format for multilevel analyses
2.  We will therefore begin with converting from long to short format
3.  It is quite simple if you only want to collapse your dataset into one variable, but more complicated with multiple as in the depression dataset

**R: using the pivot_longer function**

```{r}

depression.long <- depression %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("week") | starts_with("BDI"),
               names_to = c(".value", "session"),
               names_pattern = "(BDI|week)([0-9]+)") %>%
  mutate(session = as.integer(session))

                               
```

```{r}
depression.long.BDI <- depression %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("BDI"),
               names_to = "session",
               values_to = "BDI",
               names_prefix = "BDI",
               names_transform = as.integer) %>%
  select(!starts_with("week")) # This excludes week from the dataset


depression.long.week <- depression %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("week"),
               names_to = "session",
               values_to = "week",
               names_prefix = "week",
               names_transform = as.integer) %>%
  select(!starts_with("BDI")) # This excludes BDI from the dataset 

depression.long2 <- inner_join(depression.long.week,
                               depression.long.BDI)
```

We can check that we get the same result

```{r}
all.equal(depression.long2, depression.long, ignore_col_order = TRUE)
```

**STATA:** as usual it is a "bit" easier in STATA

```{stata}
reshape long BDI week, i(ID) j(session)
*save depression_long.dta, replace
describe
```

## Converting to wide format

```{r}
depression.wide <- pivot_wider(depression.long, 
            names_from = session,
            values_from = c(week, BDI))

psummary(depression.wide)
```

**STATA**

```{stata}
use depression_long.dta, clear
reshape wide BDI week, i(ID) j(session)
sum
```

# Exercises

1.  Open the *diet.dta/.rds* dataset.
2.  The dataset is coded in wide format, with two variables denoting *weight* (*pre.weight* and *post.weight*). Convert the dataset to long format so that you have one column with all the values, and another column representing the timepoints
    1.  In STATA it is easier of you rename *pre_weight* and *post_weight* to *weight0* and *weight1*

# Complete, Partial and No pooling

## Complete Pooling

```{r}
sample_ids <- sample(unique(depression.long$ID), 10)

depression.long %>% 
  filter(ID %in% sample_ids) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week, 
                               y = BDI)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
```

## No pooling

**Plot**

```{r}
sample_ids <- sample(unique(depression.long$ID), 5)

depression.long %>% 
  filter(ID %in% sample_ids) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week,
             y = BDI, 
             colour = ID)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() 

sample_ids <- sample(unique(depression.long$ID), 5)

depression.long %>% 
  filter(ID %in% sample_ids) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = week,
             y = BDI, 
             colour = ID)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F)
```

# Two-Level Empty Model

1.  $Y_{ij} = \beta_{0j} + e_{ij}$
2.  i = individual
3.  j = level (i.e., group)
4.  beta_0j = mean Y for group j
5.  error_ij = error term for each individual
6.  $\beta_{0j} = \beta_0 + u_{0j}$
7.  beta_0 is the overall mean (i.e., the estimated mean of the whole sample)
8.  u_oj is the error term for the group
9.  Combining both equations we get:
10. $Y_{ij} = \beta_0 + u_{0j} + e_{ij}$
11. Meaning: *dependent_var =* *total_mean + error_term_level_2 + error_term_level_1*

```{r}
# install.packages("lme4")
# install.packages("lmerTest")

library(lmerTest)

empty_mod <- lmer(BDI ~ (1|ID), data = depression.long, REML = TRUE # Default
                  )
summary(empty_mod)
```

**STATA**

1.  In STATA we use the mixed command, where the syntax is
2.  `mixed depvar fe_equation [|| re_equation] [|| re_equation â€¦] [, options]`
3.  *fe_equation* : `[indepvars] [if] [in] [weight] [, fe_options]`
4.  *re_equation* is either: `levelvar: [varlist] [, re_options]`
5.  or: `levelvar: R.varname [, re_options]`
6.  *levelvar* is a variable identifying the group structure for the random effects at that level or is \_all representing one group comprising all observations.
7.  options, : we can use *mle* (or reml) to specify maximum likelyhood estimation and *variance* or *stddev* (among other options) to specify what to report
8.  If we want the same result as in R we must either specify (REML = FALSE in R, and , mle in STATA) or (REML = TRUE in R, and ,reml in STATA)

```{stata}
// NB change profile.do
mixed BDI || ID:, reml stddev
```

# Random Intercept Model

1.  We can now expand our model to include more independent variables
2.  In a random intercept model all levels are assumed to have the same coefficients (i.e., same slopes) and random effects represent differences in intercepts
3.  In this sense, intercepts for levels are conceptualized as drawn from a normal distribution for intercepts.
4.  Intercepts for level 2 are drawn from the pooled distribution
5.  Intercepts for level 1 are drawn from the individual distributions for values in level 2
6.  We now estimate the same model, only including week as a predictor
7.  This then becomes akin to a repeated measures ANOVA, where the grouping variable is participant ID

```{r}
random_int <- lmer(BDI ~ week + (1|ID), data = depression.long, REML = TRUE)
summary(random_int)
```

```{stata}
mixed BDI week || ID: , reml stddev
```

### Visualizing the model

```{r}
library(margins)
ID_sample <- depression.long$ID |> unique() |> sample(5) |> as.character()
ID_sample

predictions <- margins(random_int, at = list(week = c(0,33),
                                             ID = ID_sample
                                             )
                       )

predictions %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week,
             y = fitted,
             colour = ID)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  # adding estimated regline using maximum likelyhood
  geom_abline(intercept = random_int@beta[1],
              slope = random_int@beta[2], linewidth = 1.5,
              color = "darkblue") +
  geom_smooth(data = depression.long, aes(x = week, 
              y = BDI,
              colour = "red"),method = "lm", se = F, inherit.aes = F)



```

**STATA**

1.  I havent found a(n easy) way of visualizing this in STATA

## Random Coefficents Model

1.  We can further expand our model to allow differences in slope across levels (i.e., differences in slope for those who have jobs/not, and individual differences in slopes + intercept)
2.  We can either choose to assess intercepts and slope as independent, or as dependent

```{r}
# Dependendent
rand_coeff <- lmer(BDI ~ week + (1 + week|ID), 
                   data = depression.long,
                   REML = TRUE # Again this is the default so it is not really necessary to specify it
                   )
summary(rand_coeff)
# Independent 0 = no intercept
rand_coeff <- lmer(BDI ~ week + (1|ID) + (0 + week|ID), 
                   data = depression.long,
                   REML = TRUE)
summary(rand_coeff)
```

1.  The margins function/package is easy to use, and can visualize a lot of different models. However, as you become more comfortable with R i recommend using the predict function instead, which generates predicted values for your participants, based on a model.
2.  This is particularly useful with multilevel models, where different levels have their own regressions, with differen ranges in their independent variable

```{r}
ID_sample <- depression.long$ID |> unique() |> sample(5)

pred <- rand_coeff@frame %>% 
  mutate(fitted = predict(rand_coeff)
)

pred %>% 
  filter(ID %in% ID_sample) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, 
                    y = fitted,
                    linetype = ID,
                    colour = ID)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = F) +
  geom_abline(intercept = rand_coeff@beta[1],
              slope = rand_coeff@beta[2],
              linewidth = 1.4) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = week,
                           y = BDI))

```

**STATA**

1.  By default Stata assumes that random intercepts and random slopes are independent of each other.
2.  We can change this by adding cov(unstructured) in the options

```{stata}
// Dependent 
mixed BDI week || ID: week, cov(unstructured) reml stddev
// independent
mixed BDI week || ID: week, reml stddev
```

### Interaction Terms: Random Intercept

1.  As with normal regressions we can add (in theory) as many predictors as we want, also including interaction terms
2.  Luckily for us, interaction terms can be interpreted the same way as in a normal model
3.  It might for example be that there is an interaction effect between time in therapy (i.e., week) and employment status (i.e., job)

```{r}
int_job_week <- lmer(BDI ~ week*job+ (1 |ID), 
                     data = depression.long, REML = TRUE)

summary(int_job_week)
```

```{stata}
mixed BDI c.week##i.job || ID:, reml cov(unstructured) stddev
 cov(unstructured) stddev
```

#### Visualizing Interaction

1.  The margins function is quite good, but as you get more familiar with R i recommend using the predict function, as it is more flexible

```{r}
fitted_vals <- predict(int_job_week)
fitted_df <- int_job_week@frame %>%
  mutate(fitted = fitted_vals,
         job = as.factor(job))

fitted_df %>% ggplot(aes(x = week,
                         y = fitted,
                         colour = job)) +
  geom_count(aes(x = week,
                   y = BDI, 
                   colour = job,
                 opacity = .2), 
               inherit.aes = F ) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, fullrange = T) 
  
```

```{stata}
quietly mixed BDI c.week##i.married|| ID:, mle cov(unstructured) stddev
	
// Plot 
margins, at(week = (1 33) married = (0 1))
marginsplot
	
```

### Including Random Interaction Terms

1.  We can include random interaction terms in our model as well, but we will quickly run into problems of having to few participants per group
2.  E.g.,non of our participants changed their employment status during their treatment, making it impossible to assess a unique interaction effect for each participant (they were likely only asked once)

```{r}
ID_sample <- depression.long$ID |> unique() |> sample(6)

depression.long %>% 
  filter(ID %in% ID_sample) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week,
             y = job,
             colour = ID)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path()
```

```{r}
rand_int_effect <- lmer(BDI~ week*job + (1+week*job|ID),
                        data = depression.long, REML = TRUE)
summary(rand_int_effect)
```

As mentioned we can get som convergence issues, so for demonstrative purposes i have set the max iteration to 20. It is also best to create your interaction term separately when allowing it it vary among levels.

```{stata}
gen week_job = week*job
set maxiter 20
mixed BDI c.week i.job week_job || ID: 	week job week_job, mle stddev cov(unstructured)   
	
```

### Random Intercept Model with extra levels (three level) 

```{r}
rand_coeff_ID <- lmer(BDI ~  week + (1|married) + (1|ID),
     data = depression.long, 
     REML = TRUE)
rand_coeff_ID

```

**STATA\
**NB: It seems that STATA requires the levels to be ordered correctly (i dont know why) when specifying the model. (e.g., Schools \> Classrooms \> Students, NOT: Students \> Classrooms \> Schools)

```{stata}
set maxiter 50
mixed BDI week || married:, || ID:, reml stddev
```

# Exercises

Use the longformat version of the diet.dta/.rds dataset

1.  Run a random intercept model where your independent variable is *timepoint,* and dependent variable is weight, and the level-variable is person
    1.  Optional for those using R: visualize your model using either the margins command, or the predict function
2.  Run a random slope model where your independent variable is timepoint, and dependent variable is weight, and level is person
    1.  Optional for those using R: visualize your model using either the margins command, or the predict function
3.  Run a random intercept model with an interaction term between timepoint and diet, level = person
    1.  Remember that both diet and timepoint should be treated as factors/dummy variables
4.  Visualize your interaction effect
5.  Run a three-level multilevel model where the levels are: diet and individual, dependent: weight, independent = timepoint

# Appendix

## Intra Class Correlation 

**R**

```{r}
#install.packages("performance")
library(performance)

icc(rand_coeff)

icc(rand_coeff_ID, by_group = TRUE)
```

**STATA**

```{stata}
quietly mixed BDI week || ID: week, stddev reml
estat icc

```

```{stata}
quietly set maxiter 50
quietly mixed BDI week || married:, || ID:, reml stddev cov(unstructured) 
estat icc
```

Note we get some differences sine we didnt allow the model to converge
