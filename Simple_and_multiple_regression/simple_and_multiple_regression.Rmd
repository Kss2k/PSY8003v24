# Section 1: Simple Regression

### Libraries
```{r include=FALSE}
library(Statamarkdown) # This is only necessary for me
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # Necessary for plotting data
library(dplyr)
library(pprint)
```

### Loading The Dataset

#### R

1.  Before we do anything we need to open our dataset
2.  I have saved an .RDS file for R-users.
3.  .RDS files store a single R-object
4.  This can also be accessed directly by loading the astatur package and calling the object "flats"

```{r}
# Reading the dataframe and storing it in an object named df
df <- readRDS("flats.rds") 

# Viewing the dataframe
View(df)
```

#### STATA

1.  I have stored the same dataset as a .dta file

```{stata}
// setting working directory
cd "~/Dropbox/PSY8003_v24/Lab-sessions/Simple_and_multiple_regression/"

// Loading the dataset 
use flats.dta

// Viewing the dataset
browse
```

### Getting an Overview of the Dataset

#### R

```{r}
# Base R:
summary(df)
str(df)

# I you have installed pprint 
# devtools::install_github("kss2k/pprint")
psummary(df)

```

#### STATA

```{stata}
codebook
sum 
```

#### Running a simple regression

#### R

1.  Regressions are done using the lm() function
2.  The syntax is:

```{r}

help(lm)
# lm(formula, data, subset, weights, na.action,
#    method = "qr", model = TRUE, x = FALSE, y = FALSE, qr = TRUE,
#    singular.ok = TRUE, contrasts = NULL, offset, ...)
```

3.  The most important arguments are *formula* and *data*

4.  The formula argument is derived from the mathemeatical specification of your model where "=" is substituded with "\~"

    $\hat{Y}_i \sim \hat{\beta_0} + \hat{\beta_1}X_i$

5.  Since we haven't estimated $\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1$ , we leave them out of the equation

6.  We're then left with: $\hat{Y}_i \sim X_i$

7.  The similarity between the mathematical formula, and the formula used in the *lm() function* will become more apparent when we look at more complex models (e.g., multiple- and interaction regression)

8.  Lets say we want to see how well *floor size* predicts *flat price*

```{r}
# Using named arguments and storing the model as an object 
reg_price_size <- lm(formula = flat_price ~ floor_size, 
                     data = df) 

# Using positional arguments 
reg_price_size <- lm(flat_price ~ floor_size, df)

```

1.  Note that we do not get a lot of information by just calling the model it self
2.  To fix this we can either us the base function *summary()* or the *psummary()* function from *pprint*

```{r}
summary(reg_price_size)
```

```{r}
psummary(reg_price_size)
```

#### STATA

1.  In STATA it is a bit simpler
2.  There we can use the regress command (abbreviation: reg)
3.  Syntax: *regress depvar [indepvars] [if] [in] [weight] [, options]*
4.  Since each STATA-session only uses a single dataset we do not need to specify the dataset
5.  Further the reg command automatically summarizes the model

```{stata}
reg flat_price floor_size
```

#### Interpretation

Does anyone want to interpret the results?

```{r}
cat(interpretation_reg_price_size)
```

### Plotting a Simple Regression

#### R

1.  We can use base-functions to make both 2D and 3D plots, but for plotting 2D graphs i prefer using ggplot(2)
2.  We use the ggplot function
3.  When using ggplot we must supply our dataframe
4.  ggplot works by layering graphics onto each other.
5.  Each ggplot builds upon a mapping, which most often is called by aes(x = x-axis, y = y-axis)
6.  We add layers on top using the + operator
7.  Here we use geom_smooth() to add a function summarizing our data

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = df,
       mapping = aes(x = floor_size,
                     y = flat_price)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) #se = F removes error estimates
  
```

We can improve the plot by adding participant values using geom_point()

```{r}
# We can use the same trick for autcompletion as with lm()
df %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = floor_size,
                       y = flat_price)) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) +
    geom_point()

```

We can also add the baseline model (i.e., the mean) using hline() (horizontal line)

```{r}
ggplot(data = df,
       mapping = aes(x = floor_size,
                     y = flat_price)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(df$flat_price), 
             color = "red",
             linewidth = 1) 
```

We can customize labels using the labs() argument

```{r}
ggplot(data = df,
       mapping = aes(x = floor_size,
                     y = flat_price)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(df$flat_price),
             color = "red",
             linewidth = 1) +
  labs(x = "Flat Price $", y = "Floor Size sqm")
  
```

#### STATA

1.  We can achieve the same in STATA using the twoway command.
2.  The twoway command builds upon the plot command, but allows layering of different plots
3.  It is a bit more restricted than ggplot, so we have to be a bit creative

Basic Regression Plot

```{stata}
twoway lfit flat_price floor_size

```

![](images/Skjermbilde%202023-06-02%20172111.png){width="677"}

Adding data points

```{stata}
twoway (lfit flat_price floor_size) (scatter flat_price floor_size) 
```

![](images/Skjermbilde%202023-06-02%20193540.png)

Adding a mean line (this is where we have to

```{stata}
// Creating a custom function and applying it to flat_price, creating a variable which is mean of flatprice
egen mean_var = mean(flat_price) 

// Plot
twoway (lfit flat_price floor_size) (scatter flat_price floor_size) (lfit mean_var floor_size)

```

## Exercises

1.  Run a regression between flat price and year built
2.  Interpret the model as a whole, and the coefficients
3.  Create a graph representing your model

# Section 2: Multiple Regression

### R

1.  We use the exact same function for a multiple regression, as a simple regression
2.  As in the mathematical formula, we simply add a variable using the + operator
3.  $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_{1i}X_{1i} + ... + \beta_{2i}X_{2i}$

```{r}
reg_price_size_year <- df %>% lm(data =, 
                                 formula = flat_price ~ floor_size + year_built)
summary(reg_price_size_year)
preg(reg_price_size_year, std_beta = T)
```

### STATA

```{stata}
reg flat_price floor_size year_built
```

Anybody want to intepret the results?

```{r}
cat(interpretation_reg_price_size_year)
```

### Plotting Multiple Regressions

1.  When we have a multiple regression we can no longer represent it as is, in two dimensions.
2.  If it has only two predictors, we can represent it as a three dimensional plot

```{r}
# install.packages("plot3D")
library(plot3D)

grid_size <- 30

# NA's cause problems since it affects the surface and scatter object differently
df2 <- na.omit(df)

reg_price_size_year <- df2 %>% lm(data =, 
                                 formula = flat_price ~ floor_size + year_built)

# Creating a grid representing our regression plane
seq_floor_size <- seq(min(df2$floor_size, na.rm = T),
                      max(df2$floor_size, na.rm = T),
                      length.out = grid_size)

seq_year_built <- seq(min(df2$year_built, na.rm = T),
                      max(df2$year_built, na.rm = T),
                      length.out = grid_size)

year_size <- expand.grid(floor_size = seq_floor_size,
                   year_built = seq_year_built)

predicted_price <- predict(reg_price_size_year, 
                           newdata = year_size) |>
  matrix(ncol = grid_size, nrow = grid_size)



fitpoints <- predict(reg_price_size_year)

scatter3D(x = df2$floor_size,
          y = df2$year_built,
          z = df2$flat_price,
          # Regression plane
          surf = list(x = seq_floor_size,
                      y = seq_year_built,
                      z = predicted_price,
                      # Residuals
                      fit = fitpoints,
                      # Surface lines
                      facets = NA, 
                      col = "black"),
          # Plot Settings
          pch = 18, 
          ticktype = "detailed",
          bty = "g",
          col = "black",
            # Viewpoint 
          theta = 20, 
          phi = 15)
          
```

```{r}
# install.packages("plot3D")
library(plotly)

grid_size <- 30

# NA's cause problems since it affects the surface and scatter object differently
df2 <- na.omit(df)

# Regression
reg_price_size_year <- lm(flat_price ~ floor_size + year_built, data = df2)

# Creating a grid representing our regression plane
seq_floor_size <- seq(min(df2$floor_size, na.rm = T),
                      max(df2$floor_size, na.rm = T),
                      length.out = grid_size)

seq_year_built <- seq(min(df2$year_built, na.rm = T),
                      max(df2$year_built, na.rm = T),
                      length.out = grid_size)

year_size <- expand.grid(floor_size = seq_floor_size,
                   year_built = seq_year_built)

# For helpfiles on predict function, type help(predict.lm)
  # Here we create a matrix where columns and rows represent the x and y axes, 
  # and the datapoints represent the heigth on the z-axis. 
  # We use the values in year_size to predict the height at a given point p(x,y)
predicted_price <- matrix(predict(reg_price_size_year,
                                  newdata = year_size),
                          ncol = grid_size, 
                          nrow = grid_size, 
                          byrow = TRUE) 



plot_ly(data = df2,
        type = "scatter3d",
        mode = "markers",
        x = ~floor_size,
        y = ~year_built,
        z = ~flat_price,
        color = ~location,
        size = I(150)) %>%
  add_surface(x = seq_floor_size,
              y = seq_year_built,
              z = predicted_price,
              inherit = F,
              opacity = .5)

         
          
```

A simpler version:

```{r}
#install.packages("margins")
library(margins)
reg_price_size_year <- lm(flat_price ~ floor_size + year_built, data = df) #this must be called this way, for the persp function to work

persp(reg_price_size_year, 
      xvar = "floor_size", 
      yvar = "year_built",
      theta = -30,
      phi = 15)
```

It is however easier using 2D graphs

```{r}
library(margins)

# NB this can be written both shorter by using the seq function, and simpler by not adding a scatter-plot (which also is color-coded)

# Making a dataframe with predictions at different combinations of values
margins_regression <- margins(reg_price_size_year,
                              at = list(floor_size = seq(50,
                                                         200,
                                                         50),
                                        year_built = seq(1930,
                                                         2010,
                                                         20)
                                        )
                              )
# Converting year_built predictions to a factor, so it can be used as a categorical variable in ggplot 
margins_regression <- margins_regression %>% 
  mutate(year_built = as.factor(year_built))

margins_regression %>% 
    ggplot(mapping = aes(x = floor_size, 
                       y = fitted, 
                       colour = year_built)) +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, fullrange = TRUE) 
    
```

```{r}

# Making a dataframe with predictions at different combinations of values
margins_regression <- margins(reg_price_size_year,
                              at = list(floor_size = seq(50,
                                                         200,
                                                         50),
                                        year_built = seq(1930,
                                                         2010,
                                                         20)
                                        )
                              )

# Converting floor_size predictions to a factor, so it can be used as a categorical variable in ggplot. Here i skip overwriting margins_regression, instead piping it right into ggplot
margins_regression %>% 
  mutate(floor_size = as.factor(floor_size)) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year_built, 
                       y = fitted, 
                       colour = floor_size)
         ) + 
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, fullrange = TRUE) 
    
```

### More Advanced Version (for those who are interested)

1.  Here i create a version with a colorcoded scatter plot.
2.  We could continue to use the margins-command, but we might as well use the predict-function
3.  In essence we create our own dataframe derived from the datapoints in our model.
4.  We mutate the dataframe so that year_built into a categorical variable (integer not factor) we still want it to be treated as numerical in the predict function
5.  The we predict values
6.  Then we convert floor_size to a factor so it can be treated as categorical in ggplot
7.  In general this is more flexible way of plotting our model predictions.
    1.  Note that this is more complicated if we we're to map floor_size on the x-axis as there are to few observations at (i.e., one or less per category) year-ranges before 1990

    2.  In that case it would probably be better to use the margins command (see next example)

    3.  Alternatively we could use the expand.grid function...

```{r}
# Data used in our model (i.e., NA's in price, size and year are removed)
model_data <- reg_price_size_year[["model"]]

# Converting year_built into a (semi) categorical (or rather integer) variable

model_data <- model_data %>%
  mutate(floor_size = case_when(floor_size <= 50 ~ 50,
                                floor_size <= 100 ~ 100,
                                floor_size <= 150 ~ 150,
                                floor_size <= 200 ~ 200)) 
  # We must run a second instance of mutate, as we want to base our prediction on the new year_built values
model_data <- model_data %>% 
  mutate(fitted = predict(reg_price_size_year, newdata = model_data),
         floor_size = as.factor(floor_size))

model_data %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = year_built, 
                       y = fitted,
                       colour = floor_size)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(y = flat_price)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ x, se = F, fullrange = T)
  


```

```{r}
model_data <- margins(reg_price_size_year, 
                      at = list(
                        year_built = seq(1920, 2010, 30),
                        floor_size = seq(0, 200, 50)
                        ) 
) 
model_data = model_data %>% mutate(year_built = as.factor(year_built))



scatter_data <- reg_price_size_year[["model"]] %>% 
  mutate(year_built = as.factor(case_when(year_built <= 1920 ~ 1920, 
                                year_built <= 1950 ~ 1950,
                                year_built <= 1980 ~ 1980,
                                year_built > 1980 ~ 2010)
                                )
         )

model_data %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(floor_size,
             fitted,
             colour = year_built)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, fullrange = T) +
  geom_point(data = scatter_data,
             mapping = aes(floor_size,
                 flat_price)) 
  

```

### STATA

```{stata}
reg flat_price floor_size year_built

// X-axis = year_built
margins, at(year_built = (1930(50)2010) floor_size = (60(50)220))
marginsplot

// X-axis = floor_size 
margins, at(floor_size = (60(50)220) year_built = (1930(30)2010))
marginsplot
```

### Exercises

1.  Perform a multiple regression with *flat_price* as a dependent variable where independent variables are *floor_size* and *energy_efficiency*
    1.  **NB:** Note that *energy_efficiency* is coded as a nominal variable. In this exercise i want you to treat it as a continuous variable, so it must be recoded as such.
    2.  I encourage you (Regardless of which program you use) to recode the variable on your own. If you struggle to do so, i have included a solution under [Appendix: Recoding energy_efficiency]
2.  Interpret the results
3.  Visualize your model in a plot (you decide what plot you want to use)
4.  Perform a multiple regression with *flat_price* as a dependent variable where independent variables are *floor_size* *year_built* and *energy_efficiency*
5.  Interpret the results
6.  Try to visualize this model in a twodimensional plot using the margins commands in STATA, or the margins package in R (NB this is a bit harder) I have included a (suggested) solution [Appendix: Solution Exercise 6]
    1.  Tips, use the linetype and colour option in aes()

### Appendix

#### Appendix: Using ggeffects to visualize regressions.

Depending on the circumstances it can be a bit easier to use the ggeffects package, compared to the margins package, it is especially good for visualizing interaction effects.

```{r}
#install.packages("ggeffects")
library(ggeffects)

prediction <- ggpredict(reg_price_size_year, 
                        terms = c("year_built", "floor_size"))

df <- df %>% mutate(group = case_when(floor_size <= 46.8 ~ "46.8", 
                                      floor_size <= 77.4 ~ "77.4",
                                      floor_size <= 108 ~ "108"))
                                   

prediction %>% ggplot(mapping = aes(x = x,
                                    y = predicted,
                                    colour = group)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", 
              formula = y ~ x, 
              se = F) +
  # This adds a scatter plot, but is not necessary for visualizing the model
  geom_point(data = df, 
             mapping = aes(x = year_built, 
                           y = flat_price,
                           colour = group), inherit.aes = FALSE) +
  ylab("Flat Price USD") +
  xlab("Year Built")

#### R

```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate(i.energy_efficiency = case_when(energy_efficiency == "poor" ~ 1,
                                             energy_efficiency == "mediocre" ~ 2,
                                             energy_efficiency == "best" ~ 3))
# NB we could also use as.integer(energy_efficency), but this would cause the variable to be coded in reverse order (i.e., best = 1, and poor = 3)
```

#### STATA

```{stata}

// When recoding the variable this way, labels are removed and it becomes numeric. Note also that the variable is coded in reverse order

recode energy_efficiency (1 = 3) (2 = 2) (3 = 1)

reg(flat_price floor_size energy_efficiency)


```

```{stata}
// As with R there is a simpler soloution where we simple use c. (for continous) at the start of our variable when calling our regression. However the variable would come in reversed order. 

reg(flat_price floor_size c.energy_efficiency)
```

Answers to interpretations (only used to call via cat-function)

```{r}
interpretation_reg_price_size <- "1. Firstly we can see that the overall model is significant p < .001 \n

2. This means that there is less than 0.1% likelyhood to get the same results (or stronger) given no effect \n

3. Secondly we can see that the coefficient for floor_size is significant both in terms of p-value and confidence interval \n 

4. The coefficient is 5274$, meaning that flat price on average increases with 5274$ per square meter increase in floor size. \n

5. The coefficient is significant p < .001, and CI does not overlap with 0 \n
6. The intercept/constant is 121356 meaning that we predict that a flat with 0 sqm floor size would (on average) cost 121 356 $. \n

7. Lastly we can see that the model (or rather floor_size) explains 60% of the variance in flat_prize"

interpretation_reg_price_size_year <- "1. Firstly we can see that the overall model is significant p < .001 \n

2. This means that there is less than 0.1% likelyhood to get the same results (or stronger) given no effect \n

3. Secondly we can see that the coefficient for floor_size is significant both in terms of p-value and confidence interval \n 

4. We can also see that the model explains roughly 60% of the variance, and about 59% if penalized for adding an extra variable. \n 

5. Notice that this is basicly the same as our previous model, suggesting that year_built (in our dataset) is not a strong predictor of flat price \n

6. The coefficient for floor_size is 5367 (p < .001), meaning that flat price on average increases with 5367$ per square meter increase in floor size, controlled for the effect of year_built \n

7. The coefficient for year_built is 640 (p = .469), then, it seeems that year built is not associated with flat price. If we were to interpet the coefficent however, we could say that flat price (on average) increases by 640$ per one year increase in buildyear. We could then say that the price decreases (on average) by 640$ per year old it is."
